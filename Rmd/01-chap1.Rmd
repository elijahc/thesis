# Introduction {#ch:intro}

Neurological and psychiatric disease represent a significant societal burden in both advanced and developing countries (Collins et al., 2011) and there is a significant need for more effective treatments.
Recent advances in brain stimulation and recording technology have enabled development of long-desired treatment options for many of these diseases in the form of implantable devices that directly stimulate populations of neurons.
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is one such implantable device wherein patients receive electrical pulses via electrodes that have been implanted in the brain to mitigate their disease symptoms.
DBS has become an established therapy for movement disorders (Perlmutter and Mink, 2006) as well as epilepsy and psychiatric diseases (Holtzheimer and Mayberg, 2011).
Another group of implantable neurostimulators are neural prosthetics, such as cortical prostheses, which aim to restore sight in patients with congenital or acquired blindness. The body of work presented here makes progress on two unsolved challenges limiting advances in implantable neurostimulators, namely DBS state detection and more accurate cortical encoding of visual stimuli.

## Deep Brain Stimulation {#sec:dbs}

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) uses a surgically implanted stimulator to apply electrical pulses directly to the brain to mitigate symptoms of neurologic and psychiatric disease. Historically, drugs have been the primary method of treating these diseases, but DBS has emerged as a promising alternative for patients who don’t respond to pharmacotherapy. Parkinson’s disease (PD) was among the first FDA approved uses of DBS for mitigating the disease’s motor symptoms. When employed for treating PD, current best practice for DBS therapy uses constant stimulation even though its therapeutic benefits to motor symptoms are only needed when the patient is awake and trying to move (Fig 1). Current implanted stimulators are used this way because they have no way to detect when stimulation isn’t needed, such as when the patient is asleep or when lower levels of stimulation are needed to correct resting tremor. This strategy of constant stimulation, or open-loop stimulation, is less power efficient and comes with side effects such as impaired cognition, speech, gait, and balance (Hariz et al., 2008). However, activating DBS stimulation only when necessary requires a robust method for discerning when the patient’s brain needs stimulation or not. For example, a closed-loop DBS system would read out the patient’s brain state and only deliver electrical pulses during periods when the patient is awake. Closed-loop DBS is more power efficient and would have less collateral side effects by only stimulating when necessary.
